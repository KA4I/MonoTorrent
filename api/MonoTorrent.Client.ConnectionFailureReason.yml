  summary: >-
    After accepting the connection, a compatible connection encryption method could not

    be selected. Alternatively the remote peer could have reached it's open connection

    limit and simply closed the connection, or it could mean the peer did not support

    encrypted connections.

    startLine: 68
  assemblies:
  - MonoTorrent
  namespace: MonoTorrent.Client
  summary: >-
    A compatible connection encryption method was selected, but the peer closed the

    connection after the normal handshake was sent. This could mean the remote peer

    reached it's open connection limit and simply closed the connection, or it could

    mean the peer did not actually support the chosen encryption. This can happen

    if we choose to create an unencrypted outgoing connection and the peer only

    supports encrypted connections.
